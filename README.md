Virtual Platform for TB DOTS

--Project under construction --

According to the CDC, tuberculosis (TB) affects 1/3 of the world population, and over 9.6 million individuals are infected with TB as of 2014. Globally, it was ranked with HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of deaths. Thus, it remains a severe global health burden by affecting well-being, productivity, and quality of life. 

In order to prevent the spread of TB epidemic, DOTS has been recommended by the WHO as one of the most efficient and cost-effective control strategies. Among its five elements, standardized drug compliance has been enforced by community health workers who would observe patients taking medications daily. Adherence to prescribed regimen reduces risks of bacterial resistance, which is a growing issue as multidrug-resistant TB lacks many therapeutic interventions. By utilizing human-centered design approach, our aim is to provide appropriate technology for improvement of DOTS implementation.
